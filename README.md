## Introduction

This project was created as Task Two during my internship at Coding Samurai. It serves as an excellent introduction to programming concepts and Java fundamentals. The calculator allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations, with the bonus of memory functions. 

## Key Concepts

- **User Interface Design:** The calculator provides a dynamic and user-friendly command-line interface with a menu of options.
- **Input Handling:** User input is handled efficiently to select an operation and input numbers.
- **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** Functions are implemented for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Error Handling:** The program gracefully handles division by zero and invalid input values.
- **GitHub Version Control:** The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing for version control and collaboration.

## Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division
- Memory Functions (Store, Recall, and Clear)
- User-Friendly Interface with Dynamic Menu
- Error Handling for Division by Zero
